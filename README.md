Welcome to the "Learning how to learn" project!

this project is writen in HTML and styled with CSS code useing BEM methodology. inside it you can find the use of functions such as flex, hover and @keyframes animation.

To fainlize the project we'll still need to add card in the oakley section, add a top or side menu that is always visable and a couple more interactive functions.
